<h3 class="version">1.2 </h3><h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_sec"></a>
General description and notes</h2>
<p>Banbot is a bot made in C++ that aims to be simple efficient and to use very few resources of the hosting machine limiting ( even almost eliminating ) unwanted server "lags". It controls the URBAN TERROR 4.1 game and uses a an SQLite3 database to keep it's data ( the SQLite3 library is integrated in the bot so you don't have to install it seperatly on the hosting machine ). It periodically controls the server for banned players and gets rid of them denying any future access.</p>
<p>Created to go on Unix/linux machines ( <b>Windows servers not tested!</b> )</p>
<p>Inide the directory "compiled" you'll find an already compiled version of the bot tha "should" run on most linux servers ( for those who don't have to possibility to compile it directly on the server ). We advise to compile the source code on your server when possible.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Requirements"></a>
Requirements</h2>
<p>Requirements for compilation: </p>
<ul>
<li>~ Unix/linux os </li>
<li>~ g++ compiler </li>
<li>~ standard libraries</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="How_to_compile_Banbot"></a>
How_to_compile_Banbot</h2>
<ul>
<li>$cd &lt;directory&gt; </li>
<li>$make</li>
</ul>
<p>If compilation succeeds, you'll find the Banbot executable in the current folder</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Banbot_configuration"></a>
Banbot_configuration</h2>
<p>All the bot config parameters are found in BanBot.cfg. This file MUST be modified in base to your needs specifiying all the parameters asked insiede the file.</p>
<p>It's also possibile to make BanBot use a config file ( in another folder/directory ) giving it the file's location when starting the bot. Example: ./BanBot uses default config file ( same folder where the bot is situated ) ./BanBot configs/bot.cfg uses file "bot.cfg" in the folder "configs/"</p>
<p>It's possible to insert comments in the config file by adding a "#" at the beggining of the line. It's not reccomended to leave blank spaces and/or lines inside the config file.</p>
<p>Every operation in structured in the following way:</p>
<p>OptionName=OptionValue <b>(!!!WITHOUT SPACES BEFORE AND/OR AFTER THE "="!!!)</b></p>
<p>You'll have to set the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>- BOTLOG : tell the bot where to save it's logfile </li>
<li>- IP : ip of the UrT server ( !! insert the SERVER ip and not "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" </li>
<li>- PORT : UrT server port </li>
<li>- RCONPASS : server's RCON password. Without this the bot can't submit admin actions </li>
<li>- LOGPATH : server's log file ( specifying path if the bot's executable is in a different directory ) </li>
<li>- GUID : admin(s) guid(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>!ATTENTION! : all the options must be written only once ( that means you can't have two ip's ecc ) exception of "GUID". Every single GUID inserted indicates and admin ( or whoever should have rights on the bot ). You can find out about guid's by taking a look on the server's log file and take them from there. The bot will listen and execute commands only if given by people with the specified guids. This means that if you don't setup any guid, the bot won't listen to anyone!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Running_BanBot"></a>
Running_BanBot</h2>
<p>We ( bot developers ) must precise one thing: the bot has a very insignificant consumtion of resources BUT starting it up with a server log that contains 300000000 lines, it's obvious that parsing the file the bot will consume a moderate amount of resources for those 30-40 seconds it takes to get to the end of the file.</p>
<p>So if you have to startup the bot ( and not only the first time! )change logfile ( if you're not interested in keeping a log backup you can simply delete the file, the log server will recreate a new one on the next map ).</p>
<p>After this you can simply startpu the bot with: </p>
<ul>
<li>$./BanBot</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to start it up to make it run in background on your server, we advise the creation of a script .sh and to start it up with the help of "screen".</p>
<p>(botlauncher.sh)</p>
<p>/dircectory/BanBot</p>
<p>and you can start it up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>$screen -m -d sh botlauncher.sh</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="BanBot_command_list"></a>
BanBot_command_list</h2>
<p>The implemented commands so far are: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>!ban</b> &lt;number&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>where &lt;number&gt; indicates the user number of the connected client. You can easily find this by typing "\clientlist" from the game's console</p>
